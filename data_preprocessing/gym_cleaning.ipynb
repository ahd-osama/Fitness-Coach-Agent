Recommendation │              9 │ [\"Follow a regular exercise schedule. Adhere to the exercise and diet plan to get better results. It is important to approach weight gain in a healthy and balanced way, focusing on both exercise and nutrition. Keep in mind that weight gain should be gradual and focused on building lean muscle rather than increasing fat. Additionally, it's always a good idea to consult with a health care professional or registered dietitian before making any significant changes to your exercise or diet plan. Here are some important tips:- Stay hydrated by drinking enough water throughout the day. Monitor your progress and adjust your diet and exercise routine accordingly. Get adequate sleep to support muscle recovery and overall health.
